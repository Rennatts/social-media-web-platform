## Social media 
This is my first full-stack project which I started in fall 2020 after months of fully committing myself to learning web development. Now, in fall 2022, I am improving it by fixing some junior-level issues and implementing better solutions for some of the functionalities, resulting in cleaner code.


## Project Description
The project is a social media platform that uses the following technologies:

- Node.js and Express in the back-end
- MongoDB as the database
- React in the front-end
- AWS S3 to save multiple images
- Redux to handle state management

## Installation
To install the node modules in the back-end and front-end, follow these steps:

1. Use node version 16 or a previous version.
2. Navigate to the project's root directory.
3. Run the following command to install the node modules in the back-end:
```bash 
npm install
```
4. Navigate to the client folder and run the following command to install the node modules in the front-end:
```bash 
npm install
```

## How to Run

1. Navigate to the project's root directory.
2. Run the following command:
```bash 
npm run dev
```

** This command will run the back-end and front-end simultaneously.
